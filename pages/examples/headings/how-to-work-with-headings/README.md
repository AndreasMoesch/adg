# How to work with headings

# Keyboard-only usage

Nothing extraordinary to say here, just be sure to have thoroughly read [How to read and interact with websites using keyboard-only](/knowledge/keyboard-only/browsing-websites){.page}!

# Screen reader usage

**Important:** The following is only a small refresher! Before you proceed, please be sure to have thoroughly read [Introduction to desktop screen reader usage](/knowledge/desktop-screen-readers){.page}!

## Quick navigation

- `H`: jump to next heading
- `1` (up to `6`): jump to next heading on level 1 (up to 6)

**Note:** You can add `Shift` to most shortcuts to reverse direction, e.g. press `Shift + H` to jump to the **previous** heading.

## Display headings outline

As alternative to navigating through the headings directly on the page, screen readers offer a heading outline view.

### NVDA "Elements List"

    - Be sure not to focus a text input while doing this, see [NVDA #7763: Why does Insert+F7 not work when focusing a text input?](https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/7763)
