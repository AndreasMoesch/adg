# Responsive data tables

As seen [here](/examples/tables/faking-data-tables-using-aria){.page title="Faking data tables using ARIA"} and [here](/examples/tables/changing-a-tables-visual-display){.page title="Changing a table's visual display"}, tables can be displayed in non-typical ways.

This allows to create tables that change the way they appear in a responsive fashion.
