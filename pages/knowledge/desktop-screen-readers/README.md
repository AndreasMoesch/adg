# Introduction to desktop screen reader usage

WE ARE ONLY TALKING ABOUT DESKTOP SCREEN READERS!

First things first: you need to know [why screen readers are so crucial for accessibility testing](/knowledge/desktop-screen-readers/why){.page title="Why screen readers are so important to accessibility testing"} and which (of the nearly endless number of) [combinations of browsers and screen readers](/knowledge/desktop-screen-readers/relevant-combos){.page title="Relevant combinations of screen readers and browsers"} are important to care about.

Finally, we admit that they can be frustrating pieces of software - so here's our attempt of explaining [how screen readers work (and why they seem so buggy)](/knowledge/desktop-screen-readers/so-buggy){.page title="How screen readers work - and why they seem so buggy"}.
