# How to implement screen reader ready websites

# Keyboard optimisation is half the rent

Screen readers are usually controlled with a keyboard only. So everything that improves keyboard interaction, also improves screen reader interaction.

So if you haven't done this yet, go back and read [How to implement keyboard only ready websites](/knowledge/keyboard-only/how-to-implement){.page}.

# Set focus properly

# Every interaction needs to provide some feedback

# If needed, add hidden text

# Use NVDA as reference, but don't forget about JAWS!

- Konstant mit NVDA+FF testen, regelmässig mit JAWS+FF/IE Funktionalität sicherstellen!
