# How to interact with websites using a desktop screen reader

Beneath simple reading of information, most modern websites offer a lot of interactivity.

**Important:** For this article you need to know how to read websites using a desktop screen reader. Please be sure you have read [How to read websites using a desktop screen reader](/knowledge/desktop-screen-readers/reading-websites){.page} thoroughly before you continue here!

# Activating links

Press `Enter` to activate links.

# Interacting with forms

Press `Enter` to interact with editable form elements, or to submit a form. Use `Space` to expand/collapse comboboxes or to toggle checkboxes. Use `Left/Right/Up/Down` keys to toggle values. Press `Enter` to activate buttons.

Use cases:

- When reaching a textarea in browse mode, to enter text into it, press `Enter` to activate focus mode, then enter text.
    - To jump to the next input (or any other focusable element), press `Tab`.
    - To look around for non-focusable content instead, leave focus mode by pressing `Esc`, then browse around with the arrow keys.
- When reaching a text input in focus mode, you can immediately enter text.
- To toggle through the values of a combobox, make sure you are in focus mode, then use `Up` or `Down`.
- To toggle the value of a checkbox, simply hit `Space` (regardless of whether you're in browse or focus mode).

See [How to browse forms](/examples/forms/how-to-browse-forms){.page} for more detailed info about interacting with forms.

# Interacting with widgets

Interacting with widgets can be tricky, especially when ARIA roles are used. In the current state, this guide doesn't cover a lot about this topic, but in a future revision it definitely will.

In general, widgets should be controllable with similar keys like other interactive elements.
