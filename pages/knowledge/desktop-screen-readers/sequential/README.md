# Screen readers are sequential

# Two-dimensional

A sighted user using a traditional display perceives the full layout of a page in a two-dimensional way. Within fractions of a second, the user intuitively recognises the different areas of a page, for example:

- Header (typically on top with a logo)
- Navigation (typically part of the header or on the left side)
- Main content (typically the biggest area of the page, enclosed by the other areas)
- Footer (typically at the bottom)
- Etc.

# Sequential (one-dimensional)

On the other hand, a blind user using a screen reader perceives a page in a sequential (one-dimensional) way. Like a text book (or better, an audiobook), a page is read aloud by the screen reader line by line from the very top to the very bottom:

- This is due to the nature of spoken information: it is presented in a purely sequential fashion, one word after the other.
- So a screen reader can "be" always only on one single position in the whole page, similar to the cursor of a text editor.
- The screen reader reads aloud the information fragment on which its cursor currently is placed.
    - Depending on how the user navigates, typically either a full line, a word, or a single character is announced.
    - The position of the cursor can then be moved (typically with the arrow keys) by the user to another information fragment (for example from one line to the next line, or from one word to the next word), each of which then is announced by the screen reader.

This way, users typically make their way through the whole document from the very top to the very bottom - or until they find the information they are looking for. In many cases, this means that screen reader users need a lot more time to browse a webpage than visual users do.
