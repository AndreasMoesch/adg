# Why screen readers are so important to accessibility testing

Screen reader tests are considered "litmus tests" in the development of accessible user interfaces:

> If you say that something is a litmus test of something, you mean that it is an effective and definite way of proving it or measuring it. (Source: [CollinsDictionary.com](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/litmus-test))

This is because screen reader compliant websites comply with a lot of requirements that are not only important to blind people, but also to many other groups of people with special needs.

In addition, while modern web browsers are pretty forgiving with malformed website code, screen readers tend to expose such weaknesses pitiless. So they are a good tool to prove the validity code.

Still, there are a few areas that can't be validated with screen readers and thus need some special attention on their own (use of colour, contrasts, some audio and video requirements, just to name a few).

**Conclusion:** you won't get around learning how to use a screen reader if you want to design modern accessible websites.
