# Introduction to keyboard only usage

It's crucial to make sure that a website (including all their interactive controls) is controllable with keyboard only:

- If you use standard HTML controls, you're all set (because the browser takes responsibility of making them keyboard accessible).
- If you create custom elements, be sure to make them keyboard accessible yourself!
    - If you are really curious and want to learn more about this, skip ahead and read [How to implement keyboard only ready websites](/knowledge/keyboard-only/how-to-implement){.page}.


First things first: you need to learn [how to control a computer with a keyboard only](/knowledge/keyboard-only/controlling-a-computer){.page title="Controlling a computer with a keyboard only"}. After this, you will be ready to [learn how to read and interact with websites using a keyboard only](/knowledge/keyboard-only/browsing-websites){.page title="How to read and interact with websites using keyboard-only"}.

While you certainly have to know your tools to create accessible websites, it's no witchcraft.

**Notice:** with "keyboard only" we mean that no screen reader is running! Because if a screen reader is running, website navigation may behave very different. So although screen readers usually are also controlled by keyboard only, we urge you not to confuse these terms.
