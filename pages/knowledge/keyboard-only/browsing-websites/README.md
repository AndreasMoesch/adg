# How to read and interact with websites using keyboard-only

**Notice:** we are talking specifically about Windows browsers here. For macOS, Linux, and others, there exist similar keyboard shortcuts.

# Opening a website

First, make sure your web browser is open. Then:

- By pressing `Ctrl + L` (or `F6`), the focus is placed in the web browser's address bar.
- Now enter the domain as usual (e.g. `www.google.com`) and submit using `Enter`.

# Reading a website

After a while of reading, you usually have to adjust the scrolling of the page somehow:

- To scroll the viewport down, up, left, or right, use the respective arrow key.
- When tabbing through a page (see below), the viewport is scrolled automatically to the currently focused element, so using the arrow keys often isn't necessary.

# Interacting with a website

Mouse users can interact with any visible element on a page directly by clicking on it.

To interact with an element, keyboard users need move the so called "focus" through all interactive elements on a page until they reach the desired element. The currently focused element is highlighted visually.

- Use `Tab` to move from one focusable item to the next focusable item.
    - This sometimes is called "tabbing".
    - Focusable items typically are links, buttons, form controls (text edit, combobox, etc.), and all sorts of custom widgets.
    - Add `Shift` to reverse the direction.
- Use `Enter` to:
    - Activate a link or button.
    - Send a form (when a form item has focus).
        - Works for all form elements except textarea.
- Use `Space` to:
    - Toggle an element's state (for example checkbox).
    - Open or close an element (for example combobox).
- Use arrow keys to:
    - Change the value of an item (for example in a combobox, a radio button group, or within a min/max value slider widget).
    - Move the cursor (for example in a text input).

# Now it's your turn!

Using the keyboard shortcuts above (and maybe more), you should be able to use any website to its fullest.

From now on, why not try to read this complete guide without using a mouse? Learning by doing is always a good way to level up your skills!
